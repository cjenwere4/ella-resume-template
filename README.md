# ella-resume-template
LaTeX resume template, originally based upon AwesomeCV (posquit0/Awesome-CV)

This is my personal resume template; my LaTeX editor of choice is Overleaf.

To change header information, alter the awesome-cv.cls file.

To change body information, change the .tex file for each section respectively (activities.tex, education.tex, etc.)
